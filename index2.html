  <!-- Intro -->
  <div class="intro">
    <p>"I work with individuals, charities, and organisations who want to communicate more clearly, more frequently, or with greater confidence. Sometimes that’s on camera, occasionally on stage, very often it is on the page. It nearly always starts with a one-to-one chat, figuring out what someone wants to say and how they want to say it" - Kevin</p>
